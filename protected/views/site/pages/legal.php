<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 2 - Definitions</h3>
<p>1P4L is a website developed an administrated by SEIZAM: a limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) registered on the Mulhouse Trade and Companies Register under number 537537045 and its registered address is 24, avenue de Bâle, 68300 Saint-Louis, France.</p>
<p>“Users” means the internet users who display or use all or part of the Functionalities or Content available on the 1P4L website.</p>
<p>“Registered Users” have a personal “1P4L Account” associated with the provision of information which they can use to access certain Functionalities and Content.</p>
<p>“Third Parties” are 1P4L’s and/or the Users external service providers.</p>
<p>“Functionalities” are the services offered on the 1P4L website, including services that enable cooperation and communication between 1P4L, Users, and Third Parties.</p>
<p>“Content” varies in nature, and means any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photograph, image, video, messages of any kind, or any other material.</p>
<p>“Intellectual Property Rights” are any copyrights, industrial property rights, patents, trademarks, utility models, design or model (registered or otherwise), rights over software, chips and semiconductors, rights of database producers, and any other intellectual property rights, including any rights pertaining to applications for these intellectual property titles.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 3 – Application of the Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>These Terms and Conditions apply to the contractual relationship between 1P4L and Users.</p>
<p>The Terms and Conditions of use are published on the website and are available online at any time. Users cannot waive them in advance. Except where expressly agreed otherwise, an exemption from these General Terms and Conditions is valid only for the contract for which it has been requested and authorised.</p>
<p>Failure by 1P4L at any time to exercise its rights under any of these General Terms and Conditions of use cannot be deemed to constitute a waiver of its right to exercise such rights subsequently. Likewise invalidity of any one of the clauses in these terms and conditions shall not affect the validity of the other clauses.</p>
<p>1P4L is entitled, where necessary, to draw up special terms and conditions for each category of Users.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 4 – Registration and Personal Data</h3>
<p>Use of certain Functionalities and access to certain Content require the User to create a 1P4L account and provide information enabling the User to be identified.</p>
<p>Users undertake to provide full and accurate information and to update it as necessary and must, in particular, ensure their email address is valid and correctly set up in order to receive communications sent by 1P4L.</p>
<p>Except where otherwise provided, access to the Functionalities and Content is authorised for individuals aged at least 13 and is entirely free of charge.</p>
<p>Data, of a personal nature or otherwise, is collected by 1P4L when the site is used and during User registration, specifically:</p>
<ul>
	<li> IP Adress </li>
	<li> Localisation </li>
	<li> Operating System Information </li>
	<li> Browser Information </li>
	<li> Activity Log </li>
	<li> User Preferences Log </li>
</ul>
<p>This data is collected strictly in accordance with the rules for the protection of personal data, and for the sole purpose of enabling the User to access the Functionalities and Services whilst optimising the operation and efficiency thereof, but also in order to comply with current legislation.</p>
<p>In accordance with the French Law on Data Protection as recently amended by the order of 24 August 2011, Users have the option of setting the parameters on their internet browser to block the cookies installed on their computer by 1P4L in order to facilitate browsing the site and accessing certain Functionalities.</p>
<p>However, the User is warned that setting parameters in this way may lead to malfunctions in the website.</p>
<p>Users agree that their personal data may be transferred to servers situated in other countries, chosen by 1P4L, for processing or storage, when the Functionalities are used and when the Content offered is accessed.</p>
<p>The database containing personal data is registered with the French Data Protection Organisation (CNIL) under No 1543065 and its transfer to servers situated in other countries is Safe Harbour-certified by the supplier authorised by 1P4L.</p>
<p>This information is also protected by professional confidentiality, so that only an order from a competent court will allow Third Parties to access the 1P4L database.</p>
<p>However, 1P4L reserves the right to voluntarily communicate this confidential information in the event of a breach by the User of these TC or of the Special Terms and Conditions that apply to the User, or generally in the event of a wrongful act by the User causing loss or damage to 1P4L and/or to other Users or Third Parties.</p>
<p>In accordance with the French Law on Data Protection No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 (as amended), Users have a right to access, correct or withdraw any personal data collected by 1P4L.</p>
<p>This right may be exercised online by contacting the 1P4L Webmaster using the means of communication specified in Clause 1.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 5 – Available Functionalities and Content</h3>
<p>A range of Functionalities and certain Content items are made available to Users by Registered Users or by external service providers (the “Third Parties”).</p>
<p>Consequently, access to Functionalities and Content may require contracts to be signed between Users, and/or Third Parties. 1P4L is not party to these contracts and cannot be held liable for any breach thereof.</p>
<p>Furthermore, access to these external Functionalities and Content also implies acceptance of any special terms and conditions, General Terms and Conditions of use or user licences.</p>
<p>Unless indicated otherwise, these special rules shall apply concurrently with the 1P4L Terms and Conditions. However, in the event of a conflict, these TC shall take precedence.</p>
<p>As certain Content items are aimed at an informed audience, access to the 1P4L website is reserved exclusively for people who are at least 13 years old on the date on which they register.</p>
<p>It is intended that 1P4L’s offer will change regularly, either to launch new Functionalities, or to delete some Functionalities, or to amend the features of existing Functionalities.</p>
<p>Consequently, 1P4L reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to make any amendments, deletions and improvements that it considers necessary to any part of the 1P4L website and its Functionalities, without the User being entitled to claim for loss or damage of any kind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because of the evolving nature of 1P4L and the various technical constraints faced by website administrators, continuity of service at all times cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>In the event of an interruption to the Functionalities of the website, 1P4L shall use all reasonable means to remedy the situation as soon as possible and to allow the continuation of current contracts.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 6 – Availability of Content</h3>
<p>Among these Content items, all data disseminated via 1P4L are provided and published by Users who are registered Users, who have signed this contract with 1P4L for the publication, dissemination and use of their Content via the 1P4L website.</p>
<p>The law does not place on 1P4L any general obligation to monitor Content items and 1P4L has no obligation to delete in advance a Content item that is not overtly illegal.</p>
<p>The Content published on 1P4L belong to their respective owner (Registered Users) but are freely available to all Users.</p>
<p>The Registered Users alone are liable towards internet Users in the event of a complaint or challenge to their intellectual property rights over all their Content, which they guarantee to be their own.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i>Clause 7 - Procedure for reporting misuse</h3>
<p>1P4L does not pre-assess the nature, content or purpose of the Content disseminated by Registered Users and therefore cannot be held liable in the event of misuse of the Functionalities on its website by Users.</p>
<p>1P4L provides a hyperlink enabling Users, Registered Users, Third Parties or any entitled persons to immediately report any abuse.</p>
<p>1P4L undertakes to withdraw any overtly illegal Content within 72 hours following instigation of this warning procedure.</p>
<p>It is essential that this notification, which will enable 1P4L to identify the illegal Content and the access path to this content, includes the following: surname, forename, profession, contact details and nationality of the complainant; a copy of the Content at issue and the URL address of the page connecting to this Content, or the 1P4L identifier of the Registered User who published such Content; the reasons why the Content should be withdrawn; a copy of the letter addressed to the Registered User who published the content at issue, or, where necessary, proof that this Registered User could not be contacted.</p>
<p>1P4L draws Users’ attention to the fact that any reporting of a Content item that is wrongly presented as being illegal, in order to force its withdrawal, exposes the person making the report to civil and/or criminal sanctions.</p>
<p>In the event of notification of abuse relating to a Content item which is not of an overtly illegal nature, 1P4L will invite the complainant to refer the matter to the competent authorities and, where necessary, will forward said complaint to the 1P4L Registered User who published the Content at issue, inviting the Registered User to verify that the Content item does actually comply with these TC.</p>
<p>If there is any doubt as to the lawfulness of publishing such doubtful content, only a court decision that has become final or been combined with an interim enforcement measure can prevent the publication and dissemination of the Content at issue via the 1P4L website.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 8 – 1P4L’s Intellectual property</h3>
<p>1P4L supports the philosophy of open source software, therefore it distributes the greater part of its deliverable products under a GNU general public licence.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the User to refer to the licence specific to each Content item for any information concerning Intellectual Property Rights and distribution terms.</p>
<p>However, for security reasons and in order to provide identification to Third Parties, the “1P4L” logo and name are the exclusive property of 1P4L. Any reproduction or use of these elements whether commercial or otherwise is strictly prohibited except where prior written authorisation is granted.</p>
<p>The same prohibition applies to the repeated and systematic extraction of protected or unprotected elements of the website causing any loss or damage whatsoever to 1P4L, particularly with regard to French law no. 98-536 of 1st July 1998 on the legal protection of databases (transposition of Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 11 March 1996) and copyright.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 9 - Complaints</h3>
<p>Complaints or observations, particularly about Functionalities developed by 1P4L and about Content that is clearly illegal or improper, are to be sent directly to 1P4L by the method specified in Clause 1.</p>
<p>1P4L, which is not a party to any contractual relationships that may be created between Users and Third Parties, cannot be held liable or involved in these relationships, especially in the event of a dispute concerning Functionalities developed or Content made available by other service providers or concerning the terms and conditions or the performance of these contracts.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the User to make direct contact with the other contracting party: 1P4L’s role is necessarily restricted to that of mediator.</p>
<p>Thus, complaints concerning defects in or non-compliance of the Content sent or the service provided by Registered Users must be formulated in writing and sent to the contact address of the Registered User who owns the Content which is the subject of the complaint.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 10 – Termination and alteration of the relationship</h3>
<p>In the event of failure by a User to fulfil one of his/her contractual obligations and in particular of any payment incident, insolvency or breach of intellectual property rights concerning the website, Functionalities, Content or distinctive signs of 1P4L, the latter shall be entitled to deactivate and then delete the User’s account, in addition to any compensation and/or legal action before the competent courts.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 11 – Warranties and Liability</h3>
<p>1P4L offers no warranty concerning the Content hosted, disseminated or exchanged on its website by Users.</p>
<p>In the absence of any prior notification, 1P4L cannot be held liable with regard to Content and Functionalities provided by Users or Third Parties.</p>
<p>1P4L cannot be held liable for loss of income, clients, data or information stored on the 1P4L facility within the context of business use, or for indirect loss or damage sustained within the context of personal use.</p>
<p>1P4L offers no warranty as to the continued existence of the website, the Functionalities and Content made available on its website.</p>
<p>Consequently, in the event of closure of the 1P4L website, Users cannot use any loss or damage as a basis for taking action.</p>
<p>In the event of closure of the website, 1P4L undertakes to give at least 3 (three) months’ notice of the cessation of activity and to ensure insofar as is reasonable that all contracts made through 1P4L have actually been fulfilled or the payments relating thereto are reimbursed, up to the date of permanent closure.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 12 - Security</h3>
<p>Registered Users are held liable for actions effected in their name as given on their 1P4L account. Consequently, Users are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and safeguarding of their identifier and password.</p>
<p>Users who open their account on a terminal that can be accessed by third parties must therefore always ensure that they close down their session.</p>
<p>1P4L will never ask Users for their password, whether by email or any other means of communication, routine or otherwise.</p>
<p>Users are invited to forward to 1P4L any message, query or request for registration which seems questionable or which may present a risk in terms of security or confidentiality.</p>
<p>Finally, Users are requested to respect Netiquette, and report any Content that seems illegal, related to racial hatred, pornography, violence or underage grooming.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 13 – Amendment of General Terms and Conditions of Use</h3>
<p>1P4L intends to expand and develop so consequently reserves the right to update or amend the terms, conditions and wording of these General Terms and Conditions of Use at any time.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of Users to ensure they have read the latest available version of the Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
<p>As soon as such Terms and Conditions are put online, Users registered on the 1P4L website will be informed by email sent to the address they have provided for their 1P4L account.</p>
<p>Users who reject amendments or updates may de-register from the 1P4L website, provided they comply with the special terms and conditions for the Functionalities and Content for which they have registered and fulfil their obligations under current contracts.</p>
<p>In the absence of such termination, amendments to these General Terms and Conditions of Use shall be binding on all Users within 72 hours from being put published on the website.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Article 14 – Force majeur</h3>
<p>1P4L is legitimately released from its obligations arising from this document, in the event of a situation of force majeure or of events such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>labour dispute, total or partial strike at 1P4L or its suppliers, service providers, carriers, postal services, public services; </li>
	<li>unavailability of raw material or power; </li>
	<li>compulsory public authority order; </li>
	<li>occupational accidents, machinery breakdown; </li>
	<li>war; </li>
	<li>earthquake, fire, flood. </li>
</ul>
<p>1P4L shall keep the User informed, in a timely manner, of situations or events of force majeure.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Clause 15 – Applicable law – Allocation of jurisdiction</h3>
<p>These general terms and conditions, and any legal instruments arising therefrom, are subject to French Law.</p>
<p>In the event of any dispute which may arise in relation to these General Terms and Conditions or to legal instruments arising therefrom, the Parties shall endeavour to reach an amicable solution.</p>
<p>Failing an amicable agreement, jurisdiction is expressly allocated to the courts in the judicial district in which the registered office of 1P4L is situated, unless 1P4L prefers to refer the matter to any other competent court.</p>
